# ZebraPrinterManagement
Linemaster's solution to integrating Zebra label printers into SyteLine and Samanage helpdesk software.

## Purpose
This change will integrate the Zebra Printers into Syteline and Samanage help desk. It provides central management and a real-time print count. In addition to the Syteline form, the user will be able to reset the current print count, reset the print head replacement count, and automatically close an active ticket in the Samanage help desk including:

•	Changing the requester to the Quality Assurance Supervisor (Brian Larose)
•	Changing the assignee of the ticket to the Syteline form user
•	Attaching the appropriate configuration item (Zebra printer) to the ticket
•	Commenting the previous and current print count
•	Closing the ticket
